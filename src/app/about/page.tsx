          RateMyTA is a platform designed to help students share honest feedback
          about their Teaching Assistants (TAs). Whether it’s helping students understand complex concepts,
          offering timely support, or just being a great lab partner — TAs play a crucial role in education,
          and they deserve recognition.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Students can rate TAs based on their helpfulness, grading difficulty,
          availability, and more. Our goal is to help future students make
          informed decisions and give TAs constructive feedback to grow in their teaching journey.
